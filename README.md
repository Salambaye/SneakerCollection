# Sneaker Collection Web Application

**Course:** Retail (e-commerce)  
**Professor:** Prof. Marcel Stefan Wagner, PhD  
**Developer:** Salamata Nourou MBAYE 

## Project Overview

This project is a web application developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **C#**, **Razor Views**, and **Tag Helpers** in **Visual Studio 2022**. The application is inspired by an online market example and allows users to manage a collection of sneakers. The primary objective was to implement **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) entirely in the browser environment.

**Note:** No database integration is used; data is managed in memory for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, view, update, and delete sneakers.
  - **Create**: Add a new sneaker with all its properties (brand, model, size, colorway, price, etc.).
  - **Read**: View sneaker details in a dedicated page, with a clean Bootstrap layout and image preview.
  - **Update**: Edit an existing sneakerâ€™s information via a structured form (with enums, dates, and validations).
  - **Delete**: Remove a sneaker from the collection.  
     - The system always asks for confirmation before deletion, preventing accidental removals.  
     - Once confirmed, the sneaker is permanently removed from the in-memory list.
       
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search sneakers by brand, model, or category.
- **Data Types Used:** Various data types are handled, including:
  - `String` (e.g., Model, Colorway)
  - `Enum` (e.g., Brand, Category, Condition)
  - `Date` (Release Date)
  - `Boolean` (Limited Edition)
- **Form Validation:** Implemented using Data Annotations.
- **Tag Helpers:** Custom TagHelpers are created to simplify repetitive HTML elements.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout uses **Bootstrap 5** and **Bootswatch** templates.
- **Confirmation Prompts:** Deleting an item requires user confirmation to prevent accidental removal.
- **Image Previews:** Sneaker images can be previewed dynamically before saving.
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Includes features like reset to original form, dynamic description character counter, and confirmation dialogs.
